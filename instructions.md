# Description

My group have developed a novel architecture that solves problem of lipreading. Our novel architecture utilizes hypernetworks to adjust weights of the model to the speakers that weren't seen in the training data. You goal is to create a website, using HTML and CSS only that will present and describe our solution. It should be a single page containing the following content:

1. Introduction - describe what is the lipreding and why it is useful, focus on healthcare sector and patients that are unable to speak.
2. Goal - development of novel architecture that is capable of quick weights update thanks to the application of hypernetwork.
3. Method overview - in assets/overview.webp there is a visualization of our diagram. Description should be something like this:
