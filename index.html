                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Lipreading, also known as speechreading, is the ability to understand spoken language by visually interpreting the movements of the lips, face, and tongue. This skill is particularly crucial in the healthcare sector, where effective communication can be a matter of life and death. For patients who are unable to speak due to various medical conditions—such as those recovering from stroke, suffering from neurodegenerative diseases, or undergoing medical procedures that affect vocal ability—lipreading technology offers a vital communication bridge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In healthcare environments, patients who cannot vocalize their needs, pain levels, or concerns face significant challenges in receiving appropriate care. Traditional communication methods may be inadequate or impossible to use. Automated lipreading systems can revolutionize patient care by enabling healthcare providers to understand non-verbal patients, ensuring their needs are met promptly and accurately. This technology not only improves patient outcomes but also enhances the quality of care and reduces the psychological stress experienced by patients who struggle to communicate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The applications extend beyond individual patient care to include emergency situations, intensive care units, and rehabilitation settings where quick and accurate communication interpretation can significantly impact treatment decisions and patient wellbeing.

                    <h3>Revolutionary Architecture Development</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our primary objective is the development of a novel architecture that enables rapid weight adaptation through the innovative application of hypernetworks, allowing the system to quickly adapt to new speakers not seen during training.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Traditional lipreading systems face a significant challenge: they struggle to generalize to new speakers whose lip movements, facial structures, and speaking patterns differ from those in the training dataset. Our breakthrough approach addresses this limitation by developing an architecture capable of quick weight updates through hypernetwork technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The core innovation lies in the hypernetwork's ability to generate speaker-specific weight modifications in real-time, enabling the model to adapt to previously unseen individuals with minimal additional data. This represents a paradigm shift from static models that require extensive retraining for new speakers to dynamic systems that can rapidly personalize their understanding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This advancement is particularly crucial for healthcare applications, where the system must quickly adapt to new patients with varying speech patterns, facial structures, and medical conditions that may affect their lip movements.

                    <h3>Architecture Pipeline</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Support Set Processing:</strong> Samples from the support set are fed through our specialized feature extractor</li>
                        <li><strong>Spatiotemporal Feature Extraction:</strong> The feature extractor utilizes spatiotemporal convolution combined with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) to capture both spatial lip movement patterns and temporal dynamics</li>
                        <li><strong>Embedding Generation:</strong> The extracted features are transformed into rich embeddings that capture speaker-specific characteristics</li>
                        <li><strong>Cross-Attention Fusion:</strong> The embeddings are merged with ground truth labels using a cross-attention mechanism, creating contextually aware representations</li>
                        <li><strong>Hypernetwork Processing:</strong> The fused representations serve as input to our hypernetwork, which generates speaker-specific weight updates</li>
                        <li><strong>Dynamic Weight Adaptation:</strong> The hypernetwork generates weight updates for the linear prediction layer, adapting the model to the specific speaker</li>
                        <li><strong>Prediction:</strong> The updated linear layer processes query samples to predict what the user has said</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                <p>
                    This architecture elegantly combines the power of spatiotemporal feature learning with the adaptive capabilities of hypernetworks. The spatiotemporal convolution captures the essential visual patterns of lip movements, while the GRU component models the temporal dependencies critical for understanding speech sequences. The cross-attention mechanism ensures that the hypernetwork receives contextually rich information, enabling it to generate highly effective weight modifications for speaker adaptation.

                <h2>Background: Few-Shot Learning</h2>
                <p>
                    Few-shot learning is a machine learning paradigm designed to enable models to learn new tasks or adapt to new data with only a few training examples. This approach is particularly valuable in scenarios where collecting large amounts of labeled data is expensive, time-consuming, or impractical—such as in personalized healthcare applications.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    In the context of lipreading, few-shot learning allows our system to quickly adapt to new speakers using only a small number of examples. This is accomplished through the concept of support and query sets, which form the foundation of few-shot learning methodology.
                </p>

                <div class="grid">
                    <div class="card">
                        <h3>Support Set</h3>
                        <div class="image-container">
                            <img src="assets/support.webp" alt="Support Set Examples" />
                            <p class="image-caption">Examples of support set samples used for speaker adaptation</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            The support set contains a small number of labeled examples from a new speaker. These samples provide the model with essential information about the speaker's unique characteristics, including lip movement patterns, facial structure, and speaking style. Our hypernetwork uses these examples to generate speaker-specific weight adaptations.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="card">
                        <h3>Query Set</h3>

                        </div>
                        <p>
                            The query set consists of unlabeled samples from the same speaker that the model must classify or predict after adaptation. This represents the real-world scenario where the system encounters new utterances from a speaker it has just learned to recognize through the support set.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>
                    The few-shot learning paradigm is particularly well-suited for lipreading applications in healthcare, where each patient represents a unique "task" requiring rapid adaptation. Rather than requiring extensive training data from each patient, our system can quickly personalize itself using just a few examples, making it practical for real-world deployment in clinical settings.
